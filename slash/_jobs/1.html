<h5 class="m-ws-top">Our POV</h5>
<p>For us design is about context, empathy and being invisible.</p>

<p>We know we are lacking in design at the moment, and that is where you come in. We are rehauling our complete product and attempting a radical model that is going to revolutionize the education space. Shhh.</p>

<h5 class="m-ws-top">What youâ€™ll be doing:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Design UX for our product 2.0. Being able to output it in code, would be an additional bonus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Champion Usability inside the team. Regular audits + best practices for the engineering team would be ideal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be responsible for setting a design system for the product. A good sense of visual/interaction design will be an added bonus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Own the customer experience and help teams see (and deliver) it as designed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be data-driven and help measure usability of the product across flows.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 class="m-ws-top">What you'll need to succeed here:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A portfolio of work that shows your usability skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experience of having worked on a product that you are passionate about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ability to use Sketch or Code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sense of aesthetics.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
